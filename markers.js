It is one of only three operating units on the west coast. Second-year RET students use this lab to learn about logic input/outputs, PLCs, and networking. PLCs are like mini-computers that take inputs (wind speed, etc.) and respond with outputs (turn motors, etc.).',

The equipment in this lab is digital, and it includes oscilloscopes, digital multimeters, function generators, and power suppliers. Students learn how to sauder circuits, and one class even builds working transistor radios. This Computer Lab is where second-year RET students do circuit simulation and complete homework.',

     'text': 'This is the LabVolt EMS Trainer lab. College purchased the LabVolt equipment so students could become familiar with motors, motor controls, and AC/DC circuits in higher voltage (120, 220) situations. This is especially important because when working in any field of renewable energy you have to deal with shifts of power. This lab has inductor and capacitor banks for experiments dealing with phase shift in AC systems, and many different types of motors for experiments. The LabVolt equipment is also capable of converting AC into DC for some experiments.',

It has a generator on the bottom, will turn both ways to catch the wind, and catches the wind at low speeds around 10 mph. This is a working turbine that can produce around 2.7 kw of energy back into the Wasco County PUD power-grid. The urban turbine was donated by a company called Skyron. They were testing this design near the Columbia River over there. Two past RET students took data from the turbine on our regular basis.',

There are eight hydraulic training stations, and students conduct hydraulic experiments to learn about cylinders, valves, and flow rates. There is also a wide variety of mechanical tools here. One of the large mechanical projects includes dismantling a V27 nacelle to the ground (using proper safety techniques with a crane and forklift). This V27 Nacelle is a functioning turbine from a 600 kw generator. One really cool project is a stationary bike connected to a light-bulb. One student â€“ who is now working for Siemens Wind Power - built it to show how mechanical power can be converted to electricity. The alternator is a DC power source, and we can hook-up a light or voltage meter to the output.',
